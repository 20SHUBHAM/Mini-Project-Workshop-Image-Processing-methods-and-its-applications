# Mini Project Workshop: Image Processing methods and its applications

The objective of the project is to control your mouse with certain hand gestures. Red,yellow and blue coloured caps are put on the fingers which serve as an identifier for what exactly is the gesture, and then the mouse moves/clicks/selects accordingly.

The list of hand gestures is included in the workshop ppt.

The colab notebook was for interactive purposes, where each section of the code is explained in detail with examples, etc.
To try the project on your system, you need to run aries.py, with the libraries installed.


To install the libraries/dependencies: download the file requirements.txt. Then in a terminal, navigate to the location where the file is installed, using cd (path).


Then, simply run: pip install -r requirements.txt.
