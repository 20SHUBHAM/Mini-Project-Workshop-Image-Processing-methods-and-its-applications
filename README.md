The objective of the project is to control your mouse with certain hand gestures. Red,yellow and blue coloured caps are put on the fingers which serve as an identifier for what exactly is the gesture, and then the mouse moves/clicks/selects accordingly.

The list of hand gestures is included in the workshop ppt.
